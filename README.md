## ChatGPT NodeJS Vulnerable app with Payload

> This app was entirely built using ChatGPT. The idea of this came from a video where I build and break an app entirely using ChatGPT

The app is a NodeJS (Express) app, captured in `index.js`

The app can be run as a Docker-Compose deployment by running

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Nearly all the prompts used in ChatGPT to build this app are in the `prompts.md` file
